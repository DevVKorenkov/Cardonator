# Cardonator
Please don't pay attention to the project name, it is just a joke like Cardonator - Terminator, you know it =)

The base idea is to create portal where you can create question-answer cards and their collections (Mayby not only question-answer. Who knows). 
Yes, you can say that there are a lot of sites as Quizlet and others and why are you making another one. And I answer - because I can =)

These technologies are used or will be used:
.net7 - which is a backend.
Entity Framework - for interaction with the database.
Angular - which is a frontend.
